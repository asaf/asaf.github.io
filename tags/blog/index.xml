      <description>My blog was based on Octopress blogging system, based on jekyll, but I was never a ruby person, it also seems like Octopress is not so active lately,
In the other hand, Hugo feels super slim and simple, thanks to Go and Hugo, it takes only few lines to start a blog,
You can download a binary package of Hugo, but I have Go installed so it&amp;rsquo;s simply 1 command:</description>

      <description>I really wanted to revive my blog (which was hosted in Blogger), but I wanted to have more control over it, It just feels very natural for guys like me who uses vi more than GUI =)
Since Octopress docs are too long and frustrating (oh common, i just wanted a blog), I decided to dedicate few posts for it, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to record (blog, post, whatever) all the cool things i&amp;rsquo;m gonna add to my blog in the future.</description>
