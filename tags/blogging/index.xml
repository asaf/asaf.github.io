      <description>My blog was based on Octopress blogging system, based on jekyll, but I was never a ruby person, it also seems like Octopress is not so active lately,
In the other hand, Hugo feels super slim and simple, thanks to Go and Hugo, it takes only few lines to start a blog,
You can download a binary package of Hugo, but I have Go installed so it&amp;rsquo;s simply 1 command:</description>

      <description>Adding About Me page, probably one of the first thing to do, right?
Note: If you just want to say few words about yourself on the aside panel, skip to About Me on the aside panel
Adding About Page Create the page:
rake new_page[&amp;quot;about&amp;quot;]  rake creates a new page located in source/about/index.markdown
I edited mine to look like:
--- layout: page title: &amp;quot;About Me&amp;quot; comments: true sharing: true footer: true ---  Note that I removed the date line because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense in this page.</description>

      <description>If you want your blog to support comments, follow this:

      <description>I really wanted to revive my blog (which was hosted in Blogger), but I wanted to have more control over it, It just feels very natural for guys like me who uses vi more than GUI =)
Since Octopress docs are too long and frustrating (oh common, i just wanted a blog), I decided to dedicate few posts for it, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll have the time to record (blog, post, whatever) all the cool things i&amp;rsquo;m gonna add to my blog in the future.</description>
